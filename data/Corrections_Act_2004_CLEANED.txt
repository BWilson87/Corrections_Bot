(4A) Instead of imposing any penalty under subsection (3) or (4) in relation to an offence that has been proved, the hearing adjudicator may order that- (a) the prisoner appear for a hearing for the imposition of any penalties in relation to the offence if the prisoner is called to appear; and (b) the prisoner be called to appear only if the prisoner commits a subsequent offence against discipline within a period set out in the order that does not exceed 3 months beginning on the day the order is made.

(2) A hearing adjudicator may exercise the powers conferred by subsection (1) only if the adjudicator considers- (a) that the conduct that is alleged to constitute the offence may warrant a higher penalty than can be imposed by the adjudicator under section 133; or (b) that, because of the complexity of the issues likely to arise (including, without limitation, points of law), it would be appropriate for the case to be referred to a Visiting Justice; or (c) that both paragraphs (a) and (b) apply. (3) If a hearing adjudicator exercises the powers conferred by subsection (1), the adjudicator must forward a summary of his or her reasons for the decision to the Visiting Justice.

(3) If a request under subsection (1) is considered by a hearing adjudicator and the adjudicator permits the prisoner to be legally represented at the hearing, the adjudicator must refer the case to a Visiting Justice for hearing and determination in accordance with section 137. (4) If the hearing adjudicator does not permit the prisoner to be legally represented, that hearing adjudicator or another hearing adjudicator must hear and determine the case in accordance with section 133, unless it is referred to a Visiting Justice under section 134. (5) A hearing adjudicator or Visiting Justice must provide the prisoner and the prison manager with a summary in writing of his or her reasons for the decision to permit or, as the case may require, not to permit the prisoner to be legally represented. 135AImposition of penalties on prisoner who is called to appear before hearing adjudicator (1) This section applies to a prisoner- (a) for whom an order was made under section 133(4A) or 137(4A) in relation to an offence (the first offence); and (b) who is required to appear for a hearing- (i) for a subsequent offence against discipline that is alleged to have been committed during the period specified in the order; and (ii) for the imposition of any penalties in relation to the first offence if the subsequent offence is proved.
