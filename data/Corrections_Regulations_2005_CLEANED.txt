Adjournment of disciplinary hearings 40 A person who is prosecuting a disciplinary offence, and a prisoner who is charged with that offence, may apply, before or during the disciplinary hearing, to have the disciplinary hearing adjourned. 41 A person who is holding a disciplinary hearing must adjourn the disciplinary hearing if- (a) he or she is satisfied that the prisoner who is charged with the disciplinary offence has not had a proper opportunity to prepare his or her defence; or (b) he or she is satisfied that a material witness is not available to give evidence at the disciplinary hearing; or (c) the prisoner is charged with a disciplinary offence against section 129 or section 130(1) of the Act and the prisoner wishes to obtain an independent analysis of a urine sample or hair samples.

If the screening test shows a positive result the sample will be tested again using a different method to confirm the first result. 13 You will be given a copy of the test result for sample A. 14 You may be charged with an offence against discipline under section 128 or section 129 of the Act if your sample proves positive for drugs or alcohol unless it is found that you were authorised to use a drug or consume alcohol by a medical officer or health centre manager. 15 Sample B will be retained by the laboratory in case you want to have an independent test done because you do not agree with the results of the test done on Sample A. 16 You will have 48 hours after being advised of the results of the test done on sample A to elect to have sample B tested independently. 17 You will have to pay in advance for sample B to be tested. You will only be reimbursed if the sample B test results do not uphold the sample A results. 17A You will have 14 days (after the close of the day on which the 48 hours expires) to arrange and pay for sample B to be tested independently. 18 You will have 21 days (after the close of the day on which the 48 hours expires) to produce the result of the sample B tests.
